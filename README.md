# Southeastcon 2017 

This github contains the arena control software for the IEEE Southeastcon 2017 hardware competition to be held in Charlotte, NC on April 1, 2017.

# Contents:

* ArenaControl - the Arduino source code for the control electronics

   The arena source code is still a work in progress and is not yet complete.
   Please read the comments in the main ArenaControl.ino file for an offer
   of fame (and 'fortune') for helping locate and resolve issues in the code.

* 3D Files

   The OpenSCAD 3D files for the arena and stage components

* Rules

   Latest copy of the rules, and historical copies of earlier versions.

   A big thank you and appreciation to Pete Soper for his work on the five arena schematic and PCB boards:

   * Stage 1 Probe Pads - the 6x pad board behind stage 1
   * Stage 1 I2C Board - I2C board that controls the relay tree to select components
   * Stage 2 Arduino Shield - the Arduino shield with connections to each of the other boards
   * Stage 3 Quadrature Encoder - stage 3 quadrature control board
   * Controller/Display - LCD display and contest start/stop buttons
