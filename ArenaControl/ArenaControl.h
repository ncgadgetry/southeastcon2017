 *
 * I encourage everyone to read through the code and help me identify any
 *    issues. This will make the arena electronics better for both me,
 *    your team, and all the other teams.
 * Anyone who identifies any issues now (before it is complete) will have 
 *    their name listed in the collaboration section below. Once the code
 *    is listed as officially complete (expected date is January 1), will
 *    have their name listed and will received $5 gift (handed out in 
 *    Charlotte at Southeastcon - you must be present). 
 * So you can help me find the issues now and get your name listed, or 
 *    wait and hope to get your name and cash.
 * Note that only the first person to find each issue is listed (and
 *    optionally gets the cash).
 * Any bug already listed in the above known issues list are not eligible.
 *
 * COLLABORATORS / HONORS (for helping identify new issues in the software):
 *    YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE!
